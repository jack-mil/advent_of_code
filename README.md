# 2020 Advent of Code!

These are my Python 3 (maybe others languages as well) solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

They're not the most optimized or "correct" solutions I am sure, but I had fun.

These solutions use type annotation, as I wanted to try using that feature in Python for the first time.
